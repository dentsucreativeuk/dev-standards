# Our development standards

## Introduction

The following guidance details our minimum level of standards for any work created by the Development team.

This guidance is a combination of our collective experience, industry best practice and deliberate decisions made to foster consistency and ease of maintenance. The old adage goes that "80% of software development is maintenance" - so remember to think about the next developer on any project.

Our industry is young and best practice can be a moveable feast. Be deliberate in your choices and remember that just because you **can** does not mean you **should**.

These are living üçÉ documents, and can be contributed to by any member of the team, provided a pull request is made beforehand.
