# Development standards - Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the development standards documents, there are some standards (for the standards) to follow.

## Tone of voice and language
The language throughout the documents is by its nature very technical, but do not rely on acronyms or lesser known terms for programming concepts â€” no matter how technically correct they are. The guidelines should be understood by all members of the team at all levels of experience.

Do not refer to the reader in the second person within any guidance. I.e: Avoid "you" and "your". Examples:

```
// Incorrect phrasing:
If you want to use quotes here, feel free to do so.

// Correct phrasing:
If quotes are preferred here, they can be used.
```

## Use of keywords
There are keywords which are used consistently throughout the guidance, and are always rendered in **bold** type. See the [Index](/README.md) for more information.
