# Baseline browser compatibility
> Part of [Administration](/Admin/Index.md)

We **must** provide browser compatability as per the following requirements. Website pages **must** be tested thoroughly on the most recent version of all the following browsers. It is also expected that we provide feature and design parity across all compatible browsers to the highest possible standard.

Desktop browsers

 - Microsoft Edge
 - Google Chrome
 - Mozilla Firefox
 - Apple Safari

Mobile browsers

 - Google Chrome
 - Apple Safari

While we may test on other browsers to ensure content is readable and functionality is usable, any additional browser support not listed above must be agreed at the outset of a project and may incur additional cost. 

In all cases, _progressive enhancement_ **should** be employed in order to provide functionality where it is supported without degrading the overall user experience.
