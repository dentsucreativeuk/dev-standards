# Linting
> Part of [Coding](/Coding/Index.md)

The following tools and resources will should be used to lint and perform other quality checks on your code.

Linters are pre-configured with the IDE Toolkit available here:
https://github.com/dentsucreativeuk/ide-toolkit

This repository is intended to be included as a submodule in order to provide shortcuts for linting, testing and ensuring code quality.

## JavaScript
Javascript is currently linted using ESLint. This supports ES6 and the babel architecture to enable JSX support.

## CSS (SASS)
CSS is linted using stylelint. It supports the SASS syntax on as an optional addition.

## Installing and using ide-toolkit
The toolkit provided above is intended to create an editor environment in which standardised linting and quality rules are available, as well as small utilities to aid development. It **should** be used on all new projects, and **must** be used on any new ES6+ projects.
